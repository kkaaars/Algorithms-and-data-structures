# Problem 0.1: The Frog's Path

## Problem Description

In a long and narrow pond, a frog is jumping on water lilies arranged in a single row. The frog starts from the **first water lily** and wants to finish on the **last one**, jumping forward over one or two water lilies at a time. For example, from water lily number `1`, the frog can jump to water lily `3` or `4`.

Some water lilies have mosquitoes sitting on them. When the frog lands on a lily pad, it eats all the mosquitoes on that pad. The goal is to determine the path the frog should take to **maximize the number of mosquitoes it eats**.

If the frog cannot reach the last lily pad, output `-1`.

---

## Input Data Format
1. The first line contains an integer `n` — the number of lily pads in the pond (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`).
2. The second line contains `n` integers separated by spaces:
   - The `i`-th number represents the number of mosquitoes on the `i`-th lily pad (`0 ≤ ai ≤ 1000`).

---

## Output Data Format
1. **If the frog can reach the last lily pad**:
   - In the first line, print one number — the **maximum number of mosquitoes** the frog can eat.
   - In the second line, print the **sequence of lily pad indices** (in ascending order) that the frog must visit.

2. **If the frog cannot reach the last lily pad**:
   - Print `-1`.

## Constraints
- **Time Limit:** 1 second.
- **Memory Limit:** 256 MB.
- The number of lily pads, `n`, satisfies: `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`.
- The number of mosquitoes on each lily pad, `a[i]`, satisfies: `0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000`.
