# Problem 0.3: Ones (Part 2)

## Problem Description

Given a number `N`, determine how many binary strings of length `N` exist that contain exactly `K` ones.  

---

## Input Format

1. The first line of input contains two non-negative integers `N` and `K`:
   - `0 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 1000000`.

---

## Output Format

Output a single number — the number of binary strings of length `N` with exactly `K` ones.  
Since the result can be very large, output it modulo `10⁹ + 7`.

## Examples

### Input 1
**Standard Input**
```
5 2
```

**Standard Output**
```
10
```

### Input 2
**Standard Input**
```
10 0
```

**Standard Output**
```
1
```

### Input 3
**Standard Input**
```
100 50
```

**Standard Output**
```
538992043
```

## Constraints

- **Time Limit:** 1 second.
- **Memory Limit:** 256 MB.
- `0 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 1000000`.

## How to Solve

1. **Combinatorics:**  
   The number of binary strings of length `N` with exactly `K` ones is equivalent to the number of combinations of `N` choose `K`, which can be calculated as:  
   ```
   C(N, K) = N! / (K! × (N − K)!)
   ```
   However, directly calculating factorials for large `N` is inefficient, so modular arithmetic with `10⁹ + 7` is used.
