# Problem 0.4: The Order of Matrix Multiplication

## Problem Description

Given a sequence of `s` matrices \( A_1, A_2, \dots, A_s \), determine the optimal order of multiplication to minimize the total number of atomic multiplication operations. 

Matrix multiplication is associative, meaning the result of the product does not depend on the order of multiplication. However, the number of operations required depends on the placement of parentheses. The goal is to find the placement that minimizes these operations.

## Input Format

1. The first line contains the integer `s` — the number of matrices (`2 ≤ s ≤ 100`).
2. Each of the following `s` lines describes the dimensions of a matrix:
   - Line `i+1` contains two integers \( n_i \) and \( m_i \) (`1 ≤ n_i, m_i ≤ 100`), where:
     - \( n_i \) is the number of rows of the \( i \)-th matrix.
     - \( m_i \) is the number of columns of the \( i \)-th matrix.

It is guaranteed that for all \( i \) from 1 to \( s-1 \), \( m_i \) matches \( n_{i+1} \), ensuring matrix multiplication is valid.

## Output Format

Output a single number — the minimum number of atomic multiplication operations required to multiply the matrices.

## Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming (Matrix Chain Multiplication):**
   - Use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to compute the product of matrices \( A_i \) to \( A_j \).
   - Base case: \( dp[i][i] = 0 \), since a single matrix requires no multiplication.
   - Transition: For each possible split \( k \) between matrices \( A_i \) to \( A_j \):
     \[
     dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] + n_i \times m_k \times m_j)
     \]
   - Use the dimensions of matrices to calculate \( n_i \), \( m_k \), and \( m_j \).

2. **Optimization:**
   - Precompute dimensions and iterate over increasing chain lengths.
   - Use memoization to store intermediate results.
