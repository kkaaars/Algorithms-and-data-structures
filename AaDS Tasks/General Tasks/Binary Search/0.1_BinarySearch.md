# Problem 0.1: Binary Search

## Problem Description

Implement a binary search algorithm for an array of numbers sorted in non-decreasing order. **Using built-in binary search functions from standard libraries is prohibited.**

### Input Data Format
1. The first line contains an integer `n` — the number of elements in the array (`0 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10⁵`).
2. The second line contains `n` integers separated by spaces — the elements of the array. 
   - All integers belong to the interval from `−2³¹` to `2³¹ − 1`.
   - The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. The third line contains an integer `k` — the number of queries (`0 ≤ k ≤ 3 × 10⁵`).
4. The fourth line contains `k` integers separated by spaces — the query numbers. 
   - Each query is also an integer in the range `−2³¹` to `2³¹ − 1`.

### Output Data Format
For each query number `x`, output on a separate line three values separated by spaces:  
`b`, `l`, and `r`, where:
- `b` equals `1` if `x` is present in the array, or `0` otherwise.
- `l` is the index of the first element greater than or equal to `x`.
- `r` is the index of the first element strictly greater than `x`.

If no matching elements are found in the array, the returned index is considered equal to `n`.

### Example

`standart input`|`standart output`

4 1 2 2 3 5 0 1 2 3 4|0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 3 1 3 4 0 4 4

## Constraints
- **Time limit:** 3 seconds.
- **Memory limit:** 256 MB.
- The array and queries are integers within the range `−2³¹` to `2³¹ − 1`.
