# Task 0.0: Sum of Binary Search Tree Keys

## Problem Description

Given a **binary search tree** where the keys of the nodes are integers in the range from −2<sup>31</sup> to 2<sup>31</sup> − 1 inclusive, calculate the **sum of the keys** of all the nodes in the tree.

### Input Data Format
- The input file (`input.txt`) contains a sequence of numbers — the keys of the nodes in the order they were added to the tree.
- Each key is provided **one per line**.
- In a binary search tree, all keys are **unique** by definition. If a key that already exists in the tree is added again, it will be **ignored**.

### Output Data Format
- The output file (`output.txt`) contains a **single number** — the sum of the keys in the constructed binary search tree.

## Example

   `input.txt` | `output.txt`
 --------------|--------------|
 2 3            | 5|
 5 2 4 1 8 7| 27
 0 100 -100| 0

## Constraints
